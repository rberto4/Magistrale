% You will implement regularized logistic regression to predict whether 
% microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). 
% During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is
% functioning correctly. Suppose you are the product manager of the 
% factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different 
% tests. From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the 
% microchips should be accepted or rejected. To help you make the decision, 
% you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, 
% from which you can build a logistic regression model.

%% Load Data
%  The first two columns contains the X values and the third column
%  contains the label (y).

data = load('Data\ex2data2.txt');
X = data(:, [1, 2]); % regressors (features) matrix
y = data(:, 3); % labels


plotData(X, y);
grid on;
xlabel('Microchip Test 1')
ylabel('Microchip Test 2')
legend('y = 1', 'y = 0')

% The above figure shows that our dataset cannot be separated into positive 
% and negative examples by a straight-line through the plot. 
% Therefore, a straight-forward application of logistic regression 
% will not perform well on this dataset since logistic regression will only 
% be able to find a linear decision boundary.

%% Polynomial features
%  In this part, you are given a dataset with data points that are not
%  linearly separable. However, you would still like to use logistic 
%  regression to classify the data points. 
%
%  To do so, you introduce more features to use -- in particular, you add
%  polynomial features to our data matrix (similar to polynomial
%  regression).
%

% Add Polynomial Features

% Note that mapFeature also adds a column of ones for us, so the intercept
% term is handled
degree = 6; % degree of polynomial features
X_map = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2), degree); % create polynomial features

% Get train and test data
cv = cvpartition( size(X,1), 'HoldOut', 0.3); % partition data 70% train - 30% validation
idx = cv.test; % get index of validation data

X_train = X_map(~idx, :); % train data
X_validation = X_map(idx, :); % validation data
y_train = y(~idx, :); % train labels
y_validation = y(idx, :); % validation labels

%% ============= Regularizied logistic regression =============
%  Optional Exercise:
%  In this part, you will get to try different values of lambda and 
%  see how regularization affects the decision coundart
%
%  Try the following values of lambda (0, 0.1, 10).
%
%  How does the decision boundary change when you vary lambda? How does
%  the training set accuracy vary?
%

% Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = zeros(size(X_train, 2), 1);

% Set regularization parameter lambda to 0 (you should vary this)
lambda = 0;

% Compute and display initial cost and gradient for regularized logistic
% regression
[cost, grad] = costFunctionReg(initial_theta, X_train, y_train);

fprintf('Cost at initial theta (zeros): %f\n', cost);


% Set Optimization Options
options = optimset('GradObj', 'on', 'MaxIter', 400);

% Optimize
[theta, J, exit_flag] = ...
	fminunc(@(t)(costFunctionReg(t, X_train, y_train, lambda)), initial_theta, options);

legend('y = 1', 'y = 0', 'Decision boundary')

% Get classification estimates
p_train = predict(theta, X_train); % classification on train data
p_validation = predict(theta, X_validation); % classification on validation data

% Compute classification accuracy
fprintf('Train Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(p_train == y_train)) * 100);
fprintf('Validation Accuracy: %f\n', mean(double(p_validation == y_validation)) * 100);


%% A simple validation procedure

degree_max = 10; % max polynomial degree for polynomial features
accuracy_train = zeros(degree_max, 1);
accuracy_validation = zeros(degree_max, 1);

for degree = 1 : 1 : degree_max  % degree of polynomial features

X_map = mapFeature(X(:,1), X(:,2), degree); % map original features to polynomial features

X_train = X_map(~idx, :); % train data
X_validation = X_map(idx, :); % validation data


% fit not regularized logistic regression model
mdl = fitglm(X_train, y_train, 'Distribution', 'binomial'); 

% Obtain probability estimates
yhat_train_probs = predict(mdl, X_train); % estimates
yhat_test_probs = predict(mdl, X_validation);

% Threshold the estimated probabilities to obtain a classification result
yhat_train_class = yhat_train_probs > 0.5; 
yhat_test_class = yhat_test_probs > 0.5; 

% Compute accuracy
accuracy_train(degree) = mean(yhat_train_class == y_train);
accuracy_validation(degree) = mean(yhat_test_class == y_validation);
